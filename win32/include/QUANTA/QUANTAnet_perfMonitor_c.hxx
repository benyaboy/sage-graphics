/**
This class does the performance monitoring calculations for QUANTA. 
The calculations in the QUANTAnet_socketbase class are used by an instance
of this class, included in other higher level modules (an instance of this class is not generally created by the user).

Along with the API documentation, is also included, a note on the calculated parameters, the units of calculation and how they are calculated.

As mentioned, in general, an instance of this class need not be created by the user. Instead the API's provided in the higher level classes (like the showStats, logStats and sendStats) should be directly invoked whenever network monitoring statistics is required. This is because the monitoring is done in all the networking classes automatically for every data flow over a network, using an instance of this class. The user can hence use the API's of the higher level classes as mentioned above, which would ensure statistics to be extracted whenever required.

API calls should be made by the user as often as required to obtain the
monitored statistics in the netlogger format ( <label,value> pairs). 

Currectly, the following capabilities have been provided with the performance monitoring: statistics can be displayed instantaneously, logged into a user specified logfile or sent to another remote daemon for further analysis
