Observer Design Pattern's Observer class.

What is it for?  The subject-observer design pattern is an object
oriented alternative to callback functions.  We can have multiple
observers "watch" a single subject.  An observer begins to watch a
subject when the subject makes an "attach(&observer)" call.  Everytime
the subject calls its notify() method, all observers that are watching
it will react by calling their update() method.

We do not instantiate the QUANTAmisc_subject_c and the
QUANTAmisc_observer_c.  Instead, the API user creates classes that
inherit the properties of these two superclasses.  The class that
inherits the observer class properties should implement the update()
method.  The update method is a pure virtual function.  Not
implementing it would result in a compiler error.
