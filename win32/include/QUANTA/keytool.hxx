/** Key Tool Manager class.
This is a quick keytool simulator hack. It is a first try. The spec will
no doubt change over time. So the documentation describes the functionality
of the existing classes, which may or may not change in the final spec.

To begin you need to create a key tool manager which basically sets up
a directory in which is can store files to hold data for the keys
(Ptool will no doubt have its own way of doing this). Currently every
key gets 1 data file and 1 meta data file. The data file only contains
the contents of the key. The meta data file contains the meta data:
size of data, timestamp, comment.

Using the keytool manager you can get a keytool key object (a wrapper)
which gives you access to the internals of the keys- ie the actual
data, the time stamp, etc. The keytool manager is essentially a cache
between physical memory and secondary storage.

Note, the difference between a time stamp and an aux (auxiliary) time stamp
is that the former is always done on a commit. The latter is not.
The aux time stamp is used to allow user defined timestamping. e.g.
the aux time stamp can be used to record the timestamp of the original
remote data source, whereas the regular timestamp can be used to record the
time stamp of the local copy of the data.
