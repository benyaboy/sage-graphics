/** Read and write locking class.

    This class encapsulates a read-write lock in an object. Any number
    of threads can hold a given read-write lock for reading as long as
    no thread holds the read-write lock for writing. A read-write lock
    can be allocated for writing only if no thread holds teh
    read-write lock for reading or writing. Read locks are considered
    shared among threads, while write locks are exclusive.
