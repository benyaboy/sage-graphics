/** This class is a very low-level class that is designed for specific uses.
If what you want to do is checking performance characteristics of your 
application, you don't have to use this class at all. All QUANTA  
classes are updated with instrumentation features. 

QUANTAnet_perfDaemonClient_c is a specially designed class
specifically for use with QUANTAnet_perfDaemon_c class or performance 
monitoring daemon application that instantiates and utilizes QUANTAnet_perfDaemon_c class. 
This class can be used if you want to do one of the following:

First, it can be used to communicate directly with performance daemon. If you want
to send special messages to the daemon, you can use this class for the purpose.
Second, you are developing real time performance monitoring applications like QoSiMoto.

If you want to send your own special messages to performance monitoring daemon, 
you have to simply instantiate this class and use provided methods to send special 
messages to the performance daemon. If your interest is in monitoring the performance 
characteristics of other applications then you need to register as performance 
monitoring client when you instantiate this class. Read the description of constructors
to find out how to register your application as performance monitoring client.
