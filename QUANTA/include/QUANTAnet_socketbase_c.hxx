/** A base level socket class subclassed by QUANTAnet_tcp_c, QUANTAnet_udp_c, QUANTAnet_mcast_c, QUANTAnet_parallelTcp_c,  and QUANTAnet_perfMonitor_c. The class itself does no networking. It provides some common member functions that are useful for network coding. In general one does not create an instance of this type.

    This class also offers information about the bandwidth, latency, Inter-Message_delay, Jitter and Burstiness values associated with the individual socket connections. Latency and Jitter calculations are offered only if the individual subclasses have implemented and enabled it. Otherwise values will be zero.
 These calculations are used by the QUANTAnet_perfMonitor_c class
