/*This file has functions that are used for performance monitoring while using udp connections with the QUANTAnet_udp_c class 
A header containing the timestamp is prepended while a message is sent and the header is unprepended when the message is read.

Note:
Instrumentation should be enabled on both the server and the client sides to turn on the performance monitoring
