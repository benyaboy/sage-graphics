/** TCP Reflector class. This class treats TCP streams as discrete
packets/messages that can be reflected to multiple connected
clients. Clients must be created using QUANTAnet_tcpReflectorClient_c
in order to interpret the TCP stream correctly. Hence do NOT attempt to
use QUANTAnet_tcpClient_c to connect to a TCP reflector or it will corrupt 
the TCP reflector stream.
This reflector has 2 main functions: checkForNewClients() and process().
checkForNewClients, as the name suggests, checks to see if any new clients
wish to connect to the reflector. Process() does the actual work of data reflection.

checkForNewClients is called everytime process() is called. If you want the check
to be done more frequently you need to do it yourself. Similarly if you want
the process() call done more frequently it is up to you to do it. I recommend threading 
those two off and setting up a mutex so that you do not do process() and 
checkForNewClients() at the same time.
