/**
Parallel socket class. This enables us to transfer a stream of data over 
multiple sockets simultaneously.

Why is this faster than a single socket connection? The TCP protocol requires 
acknowledgement from the other end everytime it sends a packet, thus it waits 
for someting on every send.  With parallel sockets, while one socket is waiting, 
another socket connection can send data.  We therefore eliminate idle time.

If you are writing a server you need to instantiate a QUANTAnet_parallelTcpServer_c object.
Likewise if you are writing a client you need to instantiate a QUANTAnet_parallelTcpClient_c
object.

Server setup:  First, instantiate the QUANTAnet_parallelTcpServer_c class. Then call 
this object's init() method with the desired port number as parameter. 
After this, we call QUANTAnet_parallelTcpServer_c::checkForNewConnections(PortNumber).  
This is a blocking call that waits for the client to make a 
QUANTAnet_parallelTcpClient_c::connectToServer() 
call. checkForNewConnections() returns a pointer to a QUANTAnet_parallelTcpClient_c object,
which you can use to communicate with the client. Note that you do not explicitly
instantiate a QUANTAnet_parallelTcpClient_c object when you are using the server class.
You can just declare a pointer to the client object and assign to this variable the return
value of QUANTAnet_parallelTcpServer_c::checkForNewConnections function.

Client setup:  We instantiate the QUANTAnet_parallelTcpClient_c class and call the 
QUANTAnet_parallelTcpClient_c::connectToServer(MachineName,PortNumber,NumberOfSockets) method. 
We then use this object to do a write and read.
