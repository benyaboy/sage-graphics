/**
Class for thread condition variables.
Condition variables are used in conjunction with
mutexes to provide a way for threads to wait until
a condition occurs.

An example of waiting on a signal is:

\begin{verbatim}

// Lock your mutex that is protecting someState.
myMutex->lock();

// Watch for your desired state to occur.
while(someState != reached) {

	// Wait for a signal.
	myCondition->wait(myMutex);

	.... got the condition and the lock so now continue ....

}

myMutex->unlock();

\end{verbatim}

An example of sending the signal is:

\begin{verbatim}

// Lock your mutex that is protecting someState.
myMutex->lock();

// Signal that the state has been reached.
if (someState == reached) myCondition->signal();

// Unlock your mutex so that the waiting thread can continue.
myMutex->unlock();

\end{verbatim}
