/** This class acts as a server for performing remote upload and download of files.
First call the init() call and then inside a while loop call checkForNewRequests().
Use QUANTAnet_remoteParallelFileIOClient_c to connect to this server and perform the upload
and download operations.

Note: currently I am finding a strange behavior in threads that causes the
network I/O to improperly complete. Hence checkForNewRequests() currently
does not create a new thread for each client that makes an IO request. All
clients must wait in line.
