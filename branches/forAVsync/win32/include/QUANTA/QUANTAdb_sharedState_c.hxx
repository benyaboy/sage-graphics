/** Encapsulates a shared state to be maintained between multiple users.
    This class provides a base abstract class from which to derives shared state
    information which multiple users encounter.  This state needs to be managed
    by a database client in order to maintain consistency, but the client itself
    is external to the scope of the state.  This state is associated with a
    particular path and key that should not change throughout the life of the
    state.

    Updates are handled through the user of the subject-observer pattern.  The
    shared state observes the client, so when new data arrives, it will unpack
    the state information provided that sharing is enabled.  Sharing is initially
    disabled for initialization purposes, but can be enabled and disabled later
    as required.
    
    Subclasses of the shared state have the responsiblity of handling the format
    of the state for transmission.  The state will need to be packed using the
    packer instance and then sent through the database client.  This process is
    handled by each client because the packing will vary, and the send is
    dependent upon the size of the packed data.  Unpacking state information,
    however, can be done with just the data itself.
