/*
 * SoftImage picture file format (.pic).
 * Transcribed from their printed documentation.
 *
 * Ratio: is the aspect ratio of pixels for this image.
 *  This aspect is the ratio X/Y (if a pixel is 2x wider than tall,
 *   the ratio is 2.0).  For displaying images on output devices
 *   with aspect ratio different from 1.0.
 *
 * N.B. The pixel ratio is computed according to Full Frame.
 *
 * Fields: which scan-lines are present in the picture file.
 * For normal images this will be Full-frame (3), but if you use video
 * output you will probably want to double the time sampling and compute
 * only fields (every alternate scan line).
 * The field containing the top scan-line is the ODD one (1), the other
 * is EVEN (2).  The field sequence for NTSC is E-O-E-O...,
 * while for PAL O-E-O-E...
 *
 * Chained: this flag indicates the presence of other packets, generally
 * it is 1 except for the last packet where it's 0.
 *
 * Encoding part: all encoding data are coded byte-by-byte (with some
 * exceptions) so when we code raw information, we have each byte following
 * each other.  For example, here is a 512x512 RGBA picture:
 *
 * <FILE-CHUNK>
 *  id = 0x5380f643
 *  vers = 1.2 (only informatiive info)
 *  comment = 'none'
 *
 * <PICT-CHUNK>
 *  id='PICT'
 *  width=512
 *  height=512
 *  ratio=1.0
 *  fields=3 (full-frame)
 *  padding=(unused)
 *
 * <PACK-CHUNK>
 *  chained=1
 *  nb bits=8
 *  type=0
 *  fields=224 (red+green+blue)
 *
 * <PACK-CHUNK>
 *  chained=0
 *  nb bits=8
 *  type=0
 *  fields=16 (alpha)
 *
 * <SCAN-LINE 1>
 *  R,G,B,... (3x512 bytes)
 *  A,A,A,... (512 bytes)
 *
 * <SCAN-LINE 2>
 *  R,G,B,...
 *  A,...
 * ...
 *
