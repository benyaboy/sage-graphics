/** UDP and Multicast Reflector class.
Even though QUANTA's key, link, and channel concept essentially acts as a data
reflector there are  instances where a generic packet reflector (to support legacy
applications) are needed. This class fulfills that need.

This class will accept incoming UDP packets and broadcast
them to all listeners. This class also accepts incoming multicast packets and broadcasts them to
all listeners (whether they are on UDP or Multicast). In that case
all incoming UDP packets will also be broadcasted to the Multicast group.

To add a listener to the reflector the remote client simply needs to send a packet to
the reflector. The reflector will use the packet's address as the return address
for future data. If a client does not send any data for a certain period  of time
that client is removed from the reflector's list of listeners.

    If you want you can also alter the buffer completely so that the reflector will reflect an entirely different message. You can do this by changing the contents of the buffer or  by replacing the buffer entirely by allocating memory for a new buffer and stuffing it with your own data. If you choose to allocate a totally new buffer you must remember  to deallocate memory for the original buffer before substituting it with yours.                                              If after your callback function exits you do not wish the reflector to forward  the contents of the buffer, return with QUANTAnet_udpReflector_c::SKIP_DISTRIBUTION. Otherwise just return QUANTAnet_udpReflector_c::OK.
    
    Note also that the callback function will also be given a pointer to a QUANTAnet_udp_c object that can then be used to send data directly to the client that originally sent the message.
